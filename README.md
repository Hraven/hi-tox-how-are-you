this is a genetic ai wich means it takes it's strongest gen and mutates off of that 

to launch the program just launch your terminal goto the dir in wich you saved the main.py
and simply type 'python main.py' and it should lauch

if you see a smaal box in the terminal with stat press enter and i will start running again or look at the stats for a bit


if this is to fail deu to the error 'thingy has no module' replace thing with whatever pops up
go into the dist there will be a onefile exe for you wich works on windows computers without pyton 
installed so if that doesn't work ... get good

and yes i know i'm late, i may have gotten lost in what i was doing and forgot the time
